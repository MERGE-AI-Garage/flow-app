# Flow App - POC Implementation Plan (Revised)

**Status:** Phase 2 Complete - Moving to Frontend
**Started:** 2025-11-14
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-17 (Phase 2 Complete)
**Target:** Quick Proof of Concept (2-3 days)

## Overview

Streamlined implementation plan focused on delivering a working proof of concept quickly. This plan prioritizes the **minimum viable flow execution** - users can create flows, initiate them, and complete stages with handoffs.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Feature 1: Auth & My Tasks UI (ready, needs data)
- ✅ Feature 2: Flow Designer (fully functional)
- ✅ Phase 1: Backend Core (COMPLETED - re-implemented after rollback)
- ✅ Phase 2: Backend API (COMPLETED - all endpoints implemented)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Frontend Components (NEXT)

**POC Goal:** End-to-end workflow - Create template → Initiate flow → Complete stages → See in My Tasks

---

## POC Scope: What We're Building

### Core Flow (P0 - Must Have)
1. ✅ User can design a flow template with stages (DONE)
2. User can initiate a new flow from a template
3. Tasks appear in "My Tasks" for assigned users
4. User can view task details with form fields
5. User can complete a stage and handoff to next assignee
6. Flow tracks elapsed time
7. Flow reaches "Completed" status at final stage

### Deferred to Post-POC (Can Wait)
- ❌ Approval stages (approve/reject buttons)
- ❌ Task reassignment and delegation
- ❌ Activity logs and audit trail
- ❌ Public request forms
- ❌ Role-based permissions enforcement
- ❌ Stalled status detection
- ❌ Admin task list view
- ❌ Email notifications
- ❌ File attachments in forms

---

## Implementation Phases (Streamlined)

## Phase 1: Backend Core ✅ COMPLETED

### Status Update (2025-11-17)
Successfully re-implemented after rollback for Cloud Run redeployment.

### What Was Completed
- ✅ Flow execution models (FlowInstance, TaskInstance, FormDataValue, ActivityLog)
- ✅ Database migration (alembic/versions/ca6c0929fdc0)
- ✅ Request/response schemas
- ✅ Model exports and registration

**Files Created:**

**Committed:** Git commit `2ae5c23` pushed to MERGE-AI-Garage organization

---

## Phase 2: Backend API (Simplified) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Minimal API to support flow execution

**Status:** All backend endpoints implemented and server running successfully (2025-11-17)

### 2.1 Helper Service - Assignment Logic ✅
- **File:** `backend/app/services/task_assignment.py`
- **Functions:**
  - `resolve_assignee(stage, initiator, db)` - Handles USER/ROLE/INITIATOR assignment types
  - `get_next_stage(flow_template, current_stage)` - Linear stage progression
  - `get_first_stage(flow_template)` - Returns first stage (order=1)
- **Implementation:**
  - ROLE assignment returns first user in role (POC simplification)
  - USER assignment queries user by ID
  - INITIATOR returns the initiator user
  - EXTERNAL returns None (not supported in POC)

### 2.2 Flow Initiation Endpoint ✅
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/flow_instances.py` (NEW)
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/flow-instances`
- **Request Body:** `{ "flow_template_id": 1, "title": "Task Title", "description": "Optional" }`
- **Implemented Logic:**
  1. Load flow template with stages
  2. Validate template exists and is active
  3. Get first stage
  4. Resolve first stage assignee
  5. Create FlowInstance (status=Active, started_at=now)
  6. Create TaskInstance for first stage (status=Pending)
  7. Create activity log (FLOW_STARTED)
  8. Return FlowInstanceDetailResponse with calculated elapsed_time

### 2.3 Get Flow Instance Endpoint ✅

  4. Calculate elapsed time for each flow
  5. Return list of TaskInstanceDetailResponse with flow context

### 2.6 Complete Task Endpoint ✅
- **File:** `backend/app/routers/tasks.py` (NEW)
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/complete`
- **Request Body:** `{ "form_data": { "field_id": "value", ... } }` (field_id as integer key)
- **Implemented Logic:**
  1. Validate current user is assignee (403 if not)
  2. Validate task status is PENDING (400 if already completed)
  3. Validate required fields are present in form_data (400 if missing)
  4. Validate all field_ids belong to current stage
  5. Save form data as FormDataValue records (JSON values)
  6. Mark current TaskInstance as Completed (status, completed_at)
  7. Get next stage
  8. If next stage exists:
     - Resolve next assignee
     - Create new TaskInstance (status=Pending)
     - Update FlowInstance (current_stage_id, current_assignee_id)
     - Create activity log (STAGE_COMPLETED)
     - Return message: "Task completed. Flow progressed to stage..."
  9. If no next stage:
     - Mark FlowInstance as Completed (status=Completed, completed_at=now)
     - Create activity log (FLOW_COMPLETED)
     - Return message: "Task completed. Flow is now complete!"
  10. Return TaskCompleteResponse with updated FlowInstanceDetailResponse

### 2.7 Register Routers ✅

  3. Each task shows:
     - Flow title
     - Current stage name
     - Elapsed time
     - **Optional: Mini diagram preview** (collapsed by default, expandable)
     - Click → navigate to `/flows/{flow_instance_id}` (Active Flow view)
- **Simplification:** No sorting, no filtering, no search

### 4.4 Update API Client ⏳
- **File:** `frontend/src/api.ts` (MODIFY)
- Add methods:
  ```typescript
  flowInstances: {
    create: (flowId: number, data: { title: string; description?: string }) => Promise<FlowInstance>

## Development Methodology: Context7 Approach

**IMPORTANT:** This implementation follows the **Context7 methodology** as defined in CLAUDE.md and `.claude/WORKFLOW.md`.

### Context7 Principles

All code changes must follow this structured approach:

1. **Understand Context**
   - Review relevant files and architecture before making changes
   - Understand dependencies and relationships
   - Check CLAUDE.md for architectural constraints

2. **Plan with TodoWrite**
   - Break work into clear, trackable tasks
   - Use TodoWrite tool at the start of any multi-step work
   - Keep exactly ONE task as "in_progress" at a time
   - Mark tasks completed immediately after finishing

3. **Make Atomic Changes**
   - One focused change at a time
   - Each change should be testable independently
   - Avoid batching multiple unrelated fixes

4. **Document as You Go**
   - Update CLAUDE.md for architectural changes
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Keep documentation in sync with code

5. **Test Before Moving On**
   - Verify each change works before proceeding
   - Check dev server output for errors
   - Use defensive programming patterns (array safety, null checks)

6. **Follow Standards**
   - Adhere to AI Garage architecture specifications
   - Use approved services only (GCP, AI Garage, Anthropic)
   - Maintain consistency with existing code patterns

7. **Ask When Uncertain**
   - Use AskUserQuestion for clarification
   - Don't assume or guess requirements
   - Prefer explicit confirmation over implicit assumptions

### Context7 Implementation in This Plan

This POC implementation demonstrates Context7 best practices:

1. **Context Understanding:**
   - Reviewed existing codebase (FlowDesigner, MyTasks, models)
   - Analyzed PRD requirements and architectural constraints
   - Identified gap: Flow Execution is the critical missing piece

2. **Planning with TodoWrite:**
   - This plan will be tracked using TodoWrite for each phase
   - One task in-progress at a time
   - Immediate completion marking after verification

3. **Atomic Changes:**
   - Each endpoint/component is a separate, testable unit
   - Backend first (data layer), then frontend (presentation layer)
   - No mixing of unrelated features

4. **Documentation:**
   - This plan documents all architectural decisions
   - ADRs capture compliance reasoning
   - Inline comments will explain complex logic (assignment resolution, form data handling)

5. **Testing First:**
   - Each backend endpoint tested via Swagger UI before frontend integration
   - Each frontend component tested in isolation
   - End-to-end test scenario defined in Phase 5

6. **Standards Adherence:**
   - Explicit AI Garage Standards Compliance section
   - Only approved services (GCP, AI Garage, Anthropic)
   - Clear migration path from POC to production

7. **Clarification Built-In:**
   - Plan identifies simplifications vs. future features
   - Deferred items explicitly listed
   - Production considerations documented upfront

---

## Architecture Decisions (POC)

### Simplifications for Speed
1. **No pagination** - Load all tasks/templates (fine for POC scale)
2. **No caching** - Fetch fresh data on every page load
3. **Basic validation** - Required fields only, no complex rules
4. **Alert dialogs** - Use browser alerts instead of toast notifications
5. **No optimistic updates** - Wait for API responses before updating UI
6. **Static timer** - Calculate elapsed time on load (no live updates)
7. **First user in role** - ROLE assignment picks first user without rotation logic

### What We're Keeping Simple
- Form data stored as JSON (no type coercion or validation)
- Linear stage progression (no branching)
- Single assignee per stage (no parallel assignments)
- Auto-assignment only (no manual override in POC)

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Timer complexity | ✅ Store start timestamp, calculate on-the-fly |
| Assignment resolution | ✅ Simple service with clear branching |
| Form data schema | ✅ Use JSON field for flexibility |
| Missing error handling | Add try/catch around all API calls |
| UI state bugs | Use defensive programming (array safety, null checks) |

---

## Post-POC Priorities

**Once POC is working, prioritize in this order:**

1. **Admin Task List** - View all tasks across users (Feature 3.1 from PRD)
2. **Activity Logs** - Display audit trail in task detail
3. **Approval Stages** - Add approve/reject buttons (Feature 4.2 from PRD)
4. **Task Reassignment** - Allow manual assignee changes (Feature 4.3 from PRD)
5. **Better Error Handling** - Toast notifications instead of alerts
6. **Form Validation** - Field-level validation beyond required
7. **Role-Based Permissions** - Enforce admin vs member capabilities

---

## AI Garage Standards Compliance

This implementation plan strictly adheres to the AI Garage architecture specifications defined in CLAUDE.md:

### ✅ Technology Stack Compliance

**Backend (Approved):**
- ✅ **Language:** Python (as specified)
- ✅ **Framework:** FastAPI (as specified)
- ✅ **Database:** PostgreSQL via Cloud SQL (currently local for development, production-ready for GCP)
- ✅ **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (standard Python ORM)
- ✅ **Migrations:** Alembic (standard for SQLAlchemy)

**Frontend (Approved):**
- ✅ **Framework:** React with TypeScript (as specified)
- ✅ **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI (as specified)
- ✅ **Build Tool:** Vite (standard for React)
- ✅ **Type Safety:** TypeScript for all components (as specified)

**Authentication (Approved):**
- ✅ **Current:** JWT tokens with development mode bypass
- ✅ **Production Path:** Firebase Authentication (GCP) - documented for future migration
- ✅ **Note:** Using standard JWT temporarily; Firebase Auth integration is POC deferral, not architectural deviation

**Hosting & Deployment (Approved):**
- ✅ **Target:** Cloud Run (GCP) for containerized deployment
- ✅ **Current:** Local development servers (standard practice)
- ✅ **Production Ready:** Docker configuration will use Cloud Run (GCP approved)

**File Storage (Future):**
- ✅ **Planned:** Cloud Storage Buckets (GCP) when file attachments are implemented (post-POC)

### ✅ Vendor Compliance

All services use approved vendors only:
- ✅ **GCP (Google Cloud Platform):** PostgreSQL via Cloud SQL, Firebase Auth (future), Cloud Run, Cloud Storage
- ✅ **AI Garage:** No custom garage services needed for this POC
- ✅ **Anthropic:** Not applicable for this application

### ❌ Services NOT Used (Compliance Verified)

**Prohibited/Unapproved Services:**
- ❌ AWS services (not using)
- ❌ Azure services (not using)
- ❌ MongoDB or other non-approved databases (not using)
- ❌ Auth0 or other third-party auth (not using)
- ❌ Netlify, Vercel, or other non-GCP hosting (not using)

### 📋 Production Deployment Considerations (Post-POC)

When moving to production, ensure:
1. **Database:** Migrate from local PostgreSQL to GCP Cloud SQL
2. **Authentication:** Complete Firebase Authentication integration
3. **Hosting:** Deploy backend to Cloud Run (containerized)
4. **Hosting:** Deploy frontend to Cloud Run or Cloud Storage + CDN
5. **File Storage:** Use Cloud Storage Buckets for attachments
6. **Environment Variables:** Use GCP Secret Manager

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**ADR-001: Local PostgreSQL for POC**
- **Decision:** Use local PostgreSQL during POC development
- **Rationale:** Faster iteration, no cloud costs during development
- **Compliance:** PostgreSQL is approved; local vs. Cloud SQL is deployment detail
- **Migration Path:** Direct migration to Cloud SQL using same schema

**ADR-002: JWT Tokens with Development Mode Bypass**
- **Decision:** Implement JWT authentication with temporary development bypass
- **Rationale:** Unblocks development while Firebase Auth integration is deferred
- **Compliance:** Firebase Authentication (GCP) is the approved service for production
- **Migration Path:** Replace JWT validation with Firebase Auth SDK (documented in CLAUDE.md)

**ADR-003: No AI/LLM Integration in POC**
- **Decision:** Defer any AI features to post-POC phases
- **Rationale:** Core workflow management doesn't require AI
- **Compliance:** If AI features are added later, use Vertex AI (GCP) or Claude (Anthropic) only

**ADR-004: Mermaid-Style Flow Diagram Visualization**
- **Decision:** Add FlowDiagram component to visualize flow stages in diagram format
- **Rationale:** Visual flow representation improves user understanding and process clarity
- **Implementation:** Use Mermaid.js library or custom CSS/SVG for linear flow diagrams
- **Scope:** Available in Active Flows and My Tasks pages only (NOT in Flow Designer for POC)
- **Compliance:** Standard frontend library, no additional services required
- **Future:** Flow Designer preview mode can be added post-POC

---

## Notes

- Database schema is complete and flexible enough for POC + future features
- Frontend TypeScript types already defined in `types.ts`
- Authentication is disabled in dev mode (no blocker)
- All patterns (models, schemas, routers) are established and easy to follow
- Focus on happy path first, add error handling after core flow works
- **AI Garage Standards:** This plan strictly follows approved services and vendors as defined in CLAUDE.md
- **Context7 Methodology:** This plan demonstrates Context7 best practices (context understanding, atomic changes, testing first)
- **Flow Visualization:** Mermaid-style diagram component added for Active Flows and My Tasks views (NOT in Flow Designer)
